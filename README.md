# Helife suckless 0.9

This is my package of all my suckless softwares
> There might be some other software that might not be directly related to suckless softwares in the future
> But I try to keep the same philosophy of minimalism

## Dependencies :

To compile :

- Make
- cc or gcc
- base-devel 
> (no need for now but I might add python or other stuff in it to be sure)

Apps that I use at dwm startup : 
- nitrogen (Gives me my background)
- xcompmgr (Enable RGBA)

For nitrogen if you never used it before you will need to chose at least once an image trough the manager or with `nitrogen --set-auto <pathtoimage>`

> I might change nitrogen for something lighter
